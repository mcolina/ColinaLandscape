## General Information

This website was made as a side project to showcase my web development skills. It shows my UI/UX design skills, and skills with HTML, CSS and Javascript. I designed the logo, and took the majority of the photos in the website. This website is a faux landscaper website that I had made just as a side project, and based on my family's enjoyment of landscaping and yard-work. I did receive some help/input from my family while making this website.
I started this project on June 14th 2020, and completed it on June 21st 2020. ( 7 days of development ).
